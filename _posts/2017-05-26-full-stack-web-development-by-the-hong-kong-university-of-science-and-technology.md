Finally a non-science course, purely technical one, I can't wait to make my hands dirty on web development. I think every developer whether he/she is front end or back end knows web development more or less, but to make your site/single page application professional and pretty, you have to go through some courses systematically.

Most concepts are straight forward and simple, so I will only take note of those which are tricky and exceptional.

# Course 1: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Week 1: HTML & CSS

**[Void (empty) elements and self-closing start tags in HTML](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201005/void_empty_elements_and_self-closing_start_tags_in_html/)**

The void elements can only have a start tag since they can't have any content. They must not have an end tags in HTML.
The void elements in HTML 4.01/XHTML 1.0 Strict include `area, base, br, col, hr, img, input, link, meta, param`. HTML 5 currently adds `command, keygen, source` to that list.

The opposite problem is when an element that can have content is empty. If it is not a void element, it must still have an end tag.

## Week 2: Introduction to JavaScript

**Data Types**

* Number
* String
* Boolean
* Other e.g. Object

**Global variable**: if you assign a variable without declaring it with `var` in any place whether in a function or not, the variable automatically become a global variable, and the whole script can access it.
