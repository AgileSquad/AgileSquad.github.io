# Week 1: Business Models and Keeping Customers

**What is a Business Model**

by Alex Osterwalder - creator of the "business model canvas"

"a business model is really a set of assumptions or hypotheses", which you need to lay out about...
* resources and activities
* value proposition
* customer relationships
* channels
* customer segments
* cost structures
* revenue streams

by Joan Magretta:
* Business models are "stories that explain how enterprises work"
* A solid business model enables companies to tie marketplace insights to the resulting economics; linking assumptions to numbers (i.e. P&L)

**Crafting Your Business Model**
* Brokerage: Century 21, Orbitz
* Bundling: Fast-food value meals, iPod/iTunes
* Cell phone: Sprint
* Crowdsourcing: Wikipedia, YouTube
* Disintermediation: Dell, WebMD
* Fractionalization: NetJets, Time-shares
* Freemium: LinkedIn, Facebook
* Leasing: MachineryLink
* Low-touch: Walmart, IKEA
* Negative operating cycle: Amazon
* Razor/blades: Prints and ink
* Reverse Razor/blades: Kindle, iPod/iTunes
* Reverse auction: Elance.com
* Pay as you go: Electric companies
* Product to service: Zipcar
* Standardization: MinuteClinic
* Subscription: Netflix
* User communities: Angie's List

**Key points:**
* The business model construct is useful for understanding value creation for new ventures & can be a source of venture differentiation
* Diving into the details of revenues, profits (and other numbers) are important for thinking through how your new ventureâ€™s value proposition to key stakeholders can be converted
* Storytelling matters
