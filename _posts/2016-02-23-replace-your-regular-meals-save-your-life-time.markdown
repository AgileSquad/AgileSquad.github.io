I am so lazy, I hate spending time on eating, but I have to spend 0.5-1 hours to have meals every day. What a shame and a waste of time for lazy people like me, I can name 1,000 more important things than having regular food. Maybe we can DIY our meals which will take us less than 2 minutes and meanwhile meet our nutritional requirements, it also sounds good if there already exist such products.

# Options
You may have heard [Soylent](https://www.soylent.com/), which seems a excellent option. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_\(drink\))

> Soylent is a meal replacement beverage, advertised as a "staple meal", available in both liquid and powdered forms. Its creators state that Soylent meets all nutritional requirements for an average adult.

Besides the Soylent official formula are the [DIY recipes](https://diy.soylent.com/recipes). Users can use design their own nutrient profiles and recipes. 

If you take one minute to search on Google, you will find more similar products. [This page](http://www.blendrunner.com/) gives us a comprehensive comparison. 

In China, alternatives include [??](http://www.ruffood.com/), [??1024](https://github.com/stormzhang/1024) from [??](http://www.boohee.com/).

# Buy ingredients and DIY in your kitchen? 

This is definitely feasible, and you can customize the flavor of your meals as you wish. First thing of all, design you recipe. I recommend you to begin designing recipes on [Soylent DIY](https://diy.soylent.com/) by imitating U.S. government DRI. Usually I prepare ingredient every day, mix the powder and divide it to two or three serving for that day. A better way is to do a batch for like one week, liquid meals should be refrigerated and consumed ASAP before they spoil, powder form can be kept much longer.



# Some concern about the recipe 

** How much protein is healthy? **
According to [Guidance for Industry: A Food Labeling Guide (14. Appendix F: Calculate the Percent Daily Value for the Appropriate Nutrients)](http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm064928.htm), I should intake 50 g of protein per day, counting like 10% as calorie source, but on Soylent, the [most popular nutrient profile](https://diy.soylent.com/nutrient-profiles/51e4e6ca7789bc0200000007) which 410 recipes are derived from tells us we should intake 85g of protein, actually equivalent to 17% of daily calories, and the [nutrient profile calculator](https://diy.soylent.com/nutrient-profiles/calculator) even suggests me to intake 25%-calories-providing protein. That is really confusing me, how much the heck protein should I have, is 25% calories from protein healthy?

I have be taking the recipe for more than 8 months, and once per day in average, and I haven't noticeable changes in health.
