Easy-to-follow explanations and great programming assignments. Overall an excellent course!

The course is very interesting and Andrew Ng is a great teacher.

It 'a shame for the bad audio (too much compression?), as well as for quizzes and programming activities that are often too trivial.

However I recommend this course at those who want to explore these fascinating themes and at those who want deepen a little.

Very good course on introduction to M.L.

Very good introductory course, if you really want to start learning. Good coverage of basic topics, well presented, nicely prepared exercises.


Nice course!

A great machine learning course!

谢谢Ng！

Very lucid explanation of concepts by Prof. Andrew Ng. Assignments are very comprehensive that make us understand the problem in depth.

Awesome ML course, help me understand ML more.

awesome course to give the concept of machine learning, practical skill set, real cases. You never feel far away from Machine Learning after the learning.

Great course!

Learned so much from this course

Wonderful approach by Andrew Ng on the concepts in Machine Learning. It slowly picks up pace, reaches a crescendo early in the course (In week 5... Man... what an assignment that is)... And a gentle slope about supporting concepts on machine learning later. Without Tom Mosher's helpful tips, inputs and resources, I could not have finished this course. Interestingly, I got to know more about human learning by going through this course. Glad that I took this course and got to learn it.. Thank you Andrew NG & Coursera !!

Awesome course. The words of Andrew Ng that occur quite often here "If you don't understand - don't worry about it" - will stick with me in the foreseeable future :D

Very good introduction of some pretty intense concepts.

A very good course to get hands-on experience of various machine learning techniques.

very good course for beginners to learn ML

Great introductory course on machine learning. Thanks Prof. Ng for make this course available to everyone. I am proud of attending this course and would like to share with ones who are aware of the AI.

Very good course. A lot of practical examples presented by Andrew in this course. Thanks for that!

thanks

It is so cool, and helps me so much!

Good course, learnt a lot from here

This gives me very good understanding of machine learning as well as basic programming skill. Thank you so much!!

Overall excellent course, although I found the level somewhat basic.

Overall good, thanks Prof. Geoffery! A bit difficult, especially there is a lot part of RBM/DBN/DBM. There could be some CNN content included in the future. Thanks.

best one ever

quite clear lecture, and very nice teacher.

Helpful to those who are new to ML.

Very impressive and well structured course! Recommended for sure. Dr. Ng explains details with great patience which is much easier for beginner like me to have a better understanding about machine learning.

Great Course. Can gain the essential insights in the field of machine learning and lay a great foundation for more sophisticated topics in this area such as deep learning. Professor Ng shares each concept step by step in a really considerate way. It's a very enjoyable experience for me. Before this course, I have no coding experience at all. It is good for beginners and opens a new window for me.

The best course about Machine Learning

Like honestly, what a great course!!! I think i can safely say that this is the best MOOC i have ever taken. Thank you Andrew Ng!

Andrew is exceptionally great. He has a way of breaking a complex algorithm down into small steps and explaining them in the context of real world example (which I highly appreciated!). The course has been a blast and this is only the start. :-)

This is a great course on the fundamentals and the good practices of machine learning. Andrew Ng is a clear, level-headed pro who teaches a lot of stuff with clarity. The learning curve is constant, and this is great because it really means you can go at your own pace, while being sure that you will get there.

Andrew does not focus on the trendy stuff (all the deep learning) as much as on the good practices, and I think this is very valuable.

Great place to start ML! I wish Numpy was used instead of Octave. I've heard people say this is an easy course. Well, when you think of exercises, the solutions are usually just a few lines of cod. But in my opinion, the challenge is to understand each concept so well that you can explain it to an ML neophyte.

Important advice: Do ask/answer questions on the forum. I'd definitely recommend visiting the forum when stuck.

At the end, I just want to thank Professor Ng and his wonderful staff. I hope to see you guys start an advanced ML course soon.!

More mathematical foundations could be included. Other than that, it has been hell of a lot useful for my post graduation specialization. Thank you Andrew Ng and Stanford (Y)

Excellent course and very well presented. Some maths knowledge will be great but Andrew gets you through the basic understanding. Advanced calculus would obviously be beneficial but not required. Great course and recommend it to anyone wanting to understand how machine learning works and can be applied to a multitude of scenarios

Excellent intro to Machine Learning!

This course gives me a lot of confidence and satisfaction about studying new areas. I know Dr. Ng skipped a lot of math and reasoning processes throughout the course and I never felt I am an expert of machine learning. But the most important thing is that I realize this is matter of practice, deliberate practice. I obtained the mindset as a programmer and background techniques of utilizing machine learning from this course. Keep working on it.

I learnt much more than machine learning itself from this course. Prof. Ng is a great teacher. The way that he designs and teaches the course is extremely helpful for me to learn new knowledge. For every one who is new to learn machine learning and hopes to learn it, this should be his/her first course. I enjoyed the learning experience so much. Thank you Prof. Ng.

Excellent introduction to Machine Learning!

1. Very helpful course for learning ABC of ML. If you complete this course you will find it very easy to follow in more advanced ML courses.2. Sometimes I found the course assignment over-hinted by the mentors. Without knowing deeply you can complete some tasks easily and quickly.3. Expected more programming assignments in last two weeks but last two weeks only have quizzes.4. More mathematical treatment was expected; but that was intentionally avoided by Andrew Ng for this course I guess.

5. I missed the summary in text format in later video set of lectures,

legendary courses, vivid and accurate

Great introduction to Machine Learning for general audience.

Very helpful. Fundamental get cleared easily with world class pundit Andrew and a guide like Tom Mosher . There are reason why this course is highly sought. A small problem I face is that R programming is used industry wide. prefer more than Octave. Hence finding it difficult to participate in any race. Nevertheless with fundamentals from this course, R is just another language. Moreover there are pre-built packages and platform for machine available in the net. What one needs is strong fundamentals.

Awes


Excellent course to learn.

I like very much the course, I recommend it. I would have liked learned more MATLAB parallel to the course.

非常适合新手入门，没有特别繁琐的数学公式，把机器学习深入浅出的介绍了一遍，有助于大体把握各种算法的思想，对于了解这门科学有很大的帮助

Very useful!

Amazing journey. Thank you Team Coursera.

A model of what online learning should aspire to become. Incredibly clear, well-paced, and very thorough. I've audited a number of other ML classes, and not a single one even comes close to how clearly and thoroughly the material is presented by Andrew Ng.

Great materials and organization. The instructor, Andrew Ng, is an excellent teacher that turns complex ideas into simple ones to help students understand the material.

fun and informative

Perfect

太過簡單，可以拉長週數。並且可以增加難度較高的option。整體上可以輕易地入門ML。

Fantastic course especially for those who are new to the field and want to learn basics. Very well structured and organized.


Appreciate. Amazing course.

Professor Ng has turned a complex and challenging subject into an approachable topic for those of us who previously thought that nothing short of many years of study and a PhD would allow us to start with machine learning. Thank you very much for giving us such a great kick-start into this awesome new world of ML.

Excellent course!!

This has been my first online course and I have enjoyed it thoroughly.

Great introduction to Machine Learning!

It's a great introductory course to ML, especially for those who are absolutely new to this field like me. Thank you Prof. Ng and all the Coursera mentors and staff who made this course a wonderful journey into ML.

very good! I got more, thank you!

The course is nice as an introductory course to ML and set the path to learn more in the field. Many algorithms are not covered in much detail and programming assignments are also limited in terms of completexity and innovation. I think it all depends on the learner to really take skills from this couse and start applying them outside of the course to real problems, join tougher courses and dive deep into the algorithms taught in the course.

Well constructed and easy to follow, but lacks mathematical derivation.

Best course!

通过本课程的学习，我对机器学习理论有了一个全新的认识，加深了理论知识。Andrew Ng讲解的非常清晰透彻，要点与细节都非常详细，受益匪浅！非常感谢Andrew对机器学习专业领域的贡献，有了这个平台，很多人都能全面而细致地学习到了机器学习理论！

It has easy to understand and intuitive explanation of fairly complex math! and hands on's are great to complete - Thanks :)

awesome.

A very interesting and challenging class. Very well taught at a good pace and with plenty of support materials to help get through programming assignments and quizzes. The programming assignments though tricky in parts thankfully focused on only adding the critical elements so did not require writing a large volume of code. Although coding those critical elements involved using new parts of my brain. All in all, thank you Andrew Ng for a good class. Also thanks to the supportive and responsive "tutors."

Great introduction - Andrew is a great teacher. I found the programming exercises especially valuable.

Explaining very well on the essential and important concept of machine learning!

Coding exercises are all great to help me understand the basic implementation of machine learning without much dirty(non-sense) work.

I found this course to be the most enjoyable so far. The course has inspired me a great deal.

A very good introductory course to machine learning. I really enjoyed it.

Great course, but with many mistakes in the materials.

Brilliant course :)

Its a superb course to learn machine learning from basics

Great content!

Very fantastic course! I want say 'Thank you' to Pro. Andrew Ng! I've really learned a lot in machine learning!

Perfect Machine Learning Course! Thank you.

Why I can not resubmit a 5-star review?

This is probably the best ML course available online.

非常感谢！

一定要好好做习题


Great course!

Very clear useful course in a great design. Thanks Andrew Ng!

Very good course to understand and implement a large range of machine learning solutions. The only drawback I see here is the very poor level of mathematics contained in the course (it can be seen as an advantage for some), but less time spent on explaining basic maths and some dedicated to show the demonstrations behind the formulas would have been perfect!

But apart from that, the pedagogy of the course is close to perfect, Andrew makes it really logical and easy to understand ! I have spent a great time.

NB: for those who find his course too slow, I found that speeding the videos *2 is a very good solution!

Very well put together course .

Excellent Course. It helped me to get clear and detailed understanding of algorithm development and implementation


除了感谢还是感谢

It's good and informative

Extremely good course to understand machine learning for people who want to get started in ML. Highly recommended.


Good teacher, clear explanation. The homework is well designed.

This course was incredibly easy to get into. At the end of the course, I'm astonished at the breadth of the course and all the theory and applications I was introduced to. The course is very well designed and the programming assignment are intuitive and fun to solve since they mirror many real world machine learning applications. Thanks Andrew and everyone else for designing and maintaining such a great course!

Very comprehensive. Covers almost all important topics of Machine learning. Challenging yet fun. I highly recommend it.

Best course I have ever taken, hands down.

I just finished the course and enjoyed every minute spent on it. This was my first exposure to machine learning and thanks to Andrew Ng I saw the beauty of it. I will definitely dive deeper

An excellent course in applied machine learning.

Great course, and perfect explanation. Thank you Andrew Ng!

It is awesome course!

This course is good for the students who wants to make career in big data research.

Very good introduction to the concepts of ML. Andrew Ng is a great teacher introducing you gradually to the different techniques

I learned this machine learning course. This is my second course about machine learning.

Pros. [1] Mathematical backgrounds are well introduced. If their proof is quite long, the proof is omitted. [2] This course provides chance to construct major machine learning formulas using MATLAB/Octave. [3] Resources offered at last seem to be very useful to deepen my study on machine learning. I am going to use the references as a compass.

Cons. [1] Audio quality is poor. As an English learner as a second language, this makes me spend more time to capture the meaning of speech. [2]

Thanks to Professor Wu, I have a clear picture on the Machine Learning concepts. Hoping that Professor could provide other courses. Besides, the pdf. slides of this course is exquisite and they are easy for us to review the lessons.

Great course, each session starts with mathematical fundamentals of the topic for fully understanding and ends with practical implementation and programming assignment!

Excellent! I'm amazed at how much I learned. If there's is an Academy award for online courses, this would win the "best picture" award (and I wish there is to help highlight well-developed courses). Lectures, tutorials, resources were great, clear and most importantly, effective in communicating concepts, algorithms and developing the necessary programming skills (and I'm saying this after trying many others and giving up mid way). I have no doubt that this course will continue to stay relevant and evolve as this field as well as online delivery format progresses. I'm very very thankful for having access to such wonderful training material, made possible by founders of coursera, which I understand to include Prof Andrew Ng. I'm also very inspired by how coursera democratizes access to courses from top universities.

For me, it's the best course about ML.

Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class was five stars! The course had a very good balance of depth, examples, and exercises. Prof Ng always seemed to know where more explanation was needed and always provide intuitions to help understand the material.

Fantastic course with well thought out programming assignments

dope

Good introductory level course. Good code assignments at the end of each week.

This is a great course to give intuition about the major machine learning concepts. The course explains the mathematical background on an intermediate level that is just perfect to get one started on this track but not too much detailed so as to focus on the subject instead. The homeworks are very well planned and interesting, maybe a bit even too easy to complete, but lots of fun. Professor Ng is a great lecturer and I liked his style and presentations so much, that I will definitely take his other courses as well. Thank for the journey!


Interesting, engaging and well-taught course. Everything is explained clearly and extensively. Course popularity helps too, there is always enough participants in the forums to provide interesting tips and feedback. And mentors are active there too. Recommended!

Great introductory level course for machine learning, barely touch the mathematical part, but more emphasize on the programming and the pratical case. Dr. Ng explain things really well, short and clean.

It was great course, interesting and useful

I really enjoy the course and assignments. It is one of the greatest on-line course I have ever attended !!!

An excellent course that teaches the basics of Machine Learning in a pleasant and understandable way. Highly recommended!

Overall I feel the depth of the information and difficulty of the assignments is well balanced for a free online course. With barely any high level math knowledge I was able to complete the course fairly quickly. Even though the notation was sometimes hard for me to read and decipher. I appreciated the explanations in text form a lot (the lecture notes and the programming tutorials). They really helped tie the whole thing together. Sometimes hints in the pdfs for the exercises would confuse me rather than help me.

I think professor Ng is a good teacher. Pleasant to listen to. The explanations in most of the video were fairly easy to understand. Going over graphs and visualizing what was going on was really helpful in understanding the algorithms.I really like the practical tips as well, where it was explained how to analyze performance of an algorithm and what can be done to improve it based on clear metrics.

Thanks to all those involved for creating this course. I feel I understand a lot more than I did before I started but I also know this is just the tip of the iceberg.

very good explanation and assignments.

非常有用的一门课！我们走入机器学习的殿堂打下坚实基础！

Very useful introduction to machine learning concept for poeple who are completely newbie in it.

The lesson is excellent, thanks for Ng and related stuff. I appreciate the assignment very much.

perfect

Perfect course to get familiar

Amazing course

Very Excellent Course! I love this course because: the quality of the teaching is really high, Andrew NG is very clear and is able to really make you a "grip" on the concepts because he first give you an intuition on the problem and the solution, then he explains the solution and how to deal with it. It is clear that Andrew has a very deep experience as a teacher because he knows how to explain things. Moreover, he is very competent and well prepared so a high quality professor and education. The course is well composed, spanning through very useful topics. The assigment are super useful because you really "work on" code and you think about it. The assigments sometimes are not easy but it worth working on them because it is the only way to evolve. At last...this course saved my life in a bunch of machine learning job interviews and I could defend effectively from the questions. The "intuition" phase about algorithms is made simple and clear, and it is the most useful part for me because now I remember a lot and I can "abstract". The mathematical part is pretty basic, provided that you know something about matrices, vectors and derivatives, but nothing too specific: just having a "grip" on basic concept (just to know what they are and how to use them) is sufficient. So i really recommend this course to anyone would like to start with machine learning, because I already took certificates of other Data Scientists Coursera Courses and believe me, as far as I know, this is the best, well balanced and most effective course. Thanks a lot Andrew!!!

Great course with lots of theoretical material and practical advice on how to properly deploy machine learning.

It's absolutely the best course about Machine Learning for beginners
